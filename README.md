## Overview

This tool is designed for mobile developers and Q&A teams who need a straightforward way to test push notifications without complex server-side setups. It provides a clean user interface to manage configurations for multiple apps and send notifications quickly.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Cross-Platform Sending**: Send notifications to both iOS (APNs) and Android (FCM) platforms.
* **Flexible iOS Authentication**: Supports both modern `.p8` token-based authentication and legacy `.p12` certificate-based authentication.
* **Profile Management**: Save, load, and manage different configurations for all your apps. No need to re-enter credentials every time.
* **Payload & Token Persistence**: Saves your last used device tokens and JSON payload within each profile for maximum efficiency.
* **Bulk Sending**: Send a push notification to multiple devices at once by simply pasting a list of tokens.
* **Live Activity Log**: See the real-time status of your push notification dispatches, including success and failure reasons for each token.
* **Android Dry Run Mode**: Validate your FCM configuration and device tokens without actually sending a notification.
* **Built-in Support Page**: Access links to support the developer directly from the app.
